- 👋 Hi, I’m Kristina!
- 👀 I’m interested in UX design.
- 🌱 I finished Google UX Design by Google on Coursera. I'm enjoy creating everyday interactions useful, enjoyable, and accessible which includes coming up with ideas to address user problems, conducting research with users, and designing wireframes, mockups, and prototypes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects to learn new technologies.
